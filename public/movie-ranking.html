<h1>Zack's Favorite Movies</h1>

<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Avengers - End Game</h3>
<p>
    This is my favorite Marvels movie because it incorporates all my favorite
    characters from the Marvel universe.
</p>

<h3>Everything Everywhere, All at Once</h3>
<p>
    This movie was really trippy yet very entertaining to watch.
    It has a lot of psychedelic elements and incorporates an all Asian cast!
</p>

<h3>Get Out</h3>
<p>
    This movie, directed by Jordan Peele, is a thriller and a societal allegory.
    It has a very ironic plot and kept me feeling uneasy, as it should,
    throughout the film.
